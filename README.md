## Intro

**Sprint 3: Adaptive Web Design and Working with Layouts**

An interactive social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos from other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their profile.

## Figma Design Layout

## Tech Notes

<div style="display: flex; max-width: 500px; border-width: 2px; border-color: #efefef; border-style: solid; padding: 20px;">
  <img src="./images/demo/content-button.jpg" style="margin-right: 20px; height: 200px;">
  The designer requests using ellipsis with a maximum of three lines for the title and description, and one line for the image description. Also, note that the button is larger here. I do not recommend downloading the button image; it's best to style it using CSS.
</div>

<div style="display: flex; max-width: 500px; border-width: 2px; border-color: #efefef; border-style: solid; padding: 20px;">
  <img src="./images/demo/heart-like.jpg" style="margin-right: 20px; height: 94px;">
  I added padding to the heart/like button because it was being cut off on the right. You could alternatively set a max-width, but then you would need to include it in the @media queries as well. I found it simpler to add the slight padding instead. Also, note the one-line ellipsis here as well.
</div>

<div style="display: flex; max-width: 500px; border-width: 2px; border-color: #efefef; border-style: solid; padding: 20px;">
  <img src="./images/demo/roll-overs.jpg" style="margin-right: 20px; height: 100px;">
  Here we have the rollover transitions. Note that each one has a different starting transition. The pencil icon, I had originally set the width and height, but it was not displaying correctly, so I found that using the font-size width worked well.
